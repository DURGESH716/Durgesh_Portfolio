# Google-Case-Studies

## Google Case Studies Examples:
This repository contains implementation of complete data analysis six processes (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act) on a bike sharing company, where firstly the business requirement or the problem statement is determined "How to increase the customers for premium membership?". Then, data is collected from multiple sources like, experiments, surveys, company's data, open source datasets, etc. After which the data is pre-processed using various tools like (MS Excel and SQL) for Pre-Processing the data. Then, comes the phase, where the data is cleaned (80% Data Cleaning Tasks), data types are checked and formatted correctly, null values are filled, outliers are removed, etc. 

Then, we have the Analyse phase, where the cleaned data is analysed and represented using various visualization tools like (Tableau) for sharing the useful business insights with stalkholders. Finally, Decision is made on which area to work on, and the work of data analyst continues.

## What are case-studies?
A case study is an in-depth study of one person, group, or event. In a case study, nearly every aspect of the subject's life and history is analyzed to seek patterns and causes of behavior. Case studies can be used in a variety of fields including psychology, medicine, education, anthropology, political science, and social work.The hope is that learning gained from studying one case can be generalized to many others. Unfortunately, case studies tend to be highly subjective and it is sometimes difficult to generalize results to a larger population.While case studies focus on a single individual or group, they follow a format that is similar to other types of psychology writing.

## Benefits of Case-Studies?
1) Allows researchers to collect a great deal of information
2) Give researchers the chance to collect information on rare or unusual cases
3) Allows researchers to develop hypotheses that can be explored in experimental research

## Types of Case-Studies?
1) Collective case studies: These involve studying a group of individuals. Researchers might study a group of people in a certain setting or look at an entire community of people.
2) Descriptive case studies: These involve starting with a descriptive theory. The subjects are then observed and the information gathered is compared to the pre-existing theory.
3) Explanatory case studies: These are often used to do causal investigations. In other words, researchers are interested in looking at factors that may have actually caused certain things to occur.
4) Exploratory case studies: These are sometimes used as a prelude to further, more in-depth research. This allows researchers to gather more information before developing their research questions and hypotheses.
5) Instrumental case studies: These occur when the individual or group allows researchers to understand more than what is initially obvious to observers.
6) Intrinsic case studies: This type of case study is when the researcher has a personal interest in the case. Jean Piaget's observations of his own children are good examples of how an intrinsic cast study can contribute to the development of a psychological theory.
